	<h2>Tractus-X Dataspace Topology</h2>
	<section>
		<h3>
			Introduction
		</h3>
		<p>
			This document details the systems topology that Tractus-X dataspaces employ. This topology adheres to the
			model defined by the <a href="https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/dataspace-protocol/overview/model">Dataspace Protocol Specifications</a>
			(DSP):
			<ul>
				<li>The <dfn>Dataspace Authority</dfn> manages the dataspace. In a Tractus-X dataspace, this role may be
					federated across multiple operating companies responsible for registration, onboarding, and
					operations management.
				</li>
				<li>A <dfn>Participant</dfn> is a member the dataspace. In a Tractus-X dataspace, members may take on
					different roles, which are attested to by <a>Verifiable Credentials</a>
				</li>
				<li>A <dfn>Participant Agent</dfn> performs tasks such as publishing a catalog or engaging in an asset
					transfer. Note that a participant agent is a logical construct and does not necessarily correspond
					to a single runtime process.
				</li>
				<li>An <dfn>Identity Provider</dfn>  is a service that generates ID tokens used to verify the identity
					of a Participant Agent. In a Tractus-X dataspace, each participant will use their own identity
					provider, which may be self-hosted or hosted in a managed environment.
				</li>
				<li>A <dfn>Credential Issuer</dfn> issues <a>Verifiable Credentials</a> (VC) used by participant agents to
					allow access to assets and verify usage control
				</li>
				<li>
					<dfn>Verifiable Credential</dfn> see [[vc-data-model]]
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>
			Scope
		</h3>
		<p>
			This specification does not cover dataspace registration systems managed by a <a>Dataspace Authority</a>
			(operating company) as the participant registration and discovery process is out-of-scope.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>
			Identities
		</h3>
		<p>
			The DSP specifications are based on the concept that all participants have a stable identifier (ID). This
			ID is typically a number assigned to the participant business entity. In this scheme, <a>participant agent</a>
			identities may be ephemeral since all operations such as signing contract agreements are associated with the
			participant identity. This specification will also make use of DIDs [[did-core]], which can be employed to
			cryptographically verify a participant identity. These are related as follows:
		</p>
		<pre class="noghighlight">
			ID  ------ Can resolve to -----> DID
			^                                |
			|                                |
			|----------Associated with--------
		</pre>
		<p>
			A DID may also be used as an ID, but it is recommended to distinguish the two to allow for DID rotation.
			For example, a participant may opt to change its hosting environment, resulting in a change to its DID such
			as the URL associated with its DID in the case of `did:web` or its DID method. Since its Identifier remains
			stable, existing signed contracts will not be impacted.
		</p>

		<h3>Systems</h3>
		<section>
			<h4><dfn>Registration system</dfn></h4>
			<p>The registration system is responsible for participant registration, onboarding, and management.</p>
			<section>
				<h5><dfn>Registration process</dfn></h5>
				<p>
					When a participant is onboarded, it will be assigned an ID and either a secret token/code or
					Membership VC that will allow the participant to bootstrap its systems. If provided a secret token,
					the participant will be able to exchange it for a Membership VC with a <a>Credential Issuer</a>.
				</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4><dfn>Participant Agent Systems</dfn></h4>
			<p>
				Participants will run one or more agent systems that interact in the dataspace. These systems may offer
				data catalogs, perform data transfers or provide application functionality.

				A participant may run the following identity-related agents. Note that this is a logical description
				and may not represent an actual deployment topology.
			</p>
			<section>
				<h5><dfn>Security Token Service</dfn> (STS)</h5>
				<p>
					The STS creates self-issued authorization tokens that contain identity claims used by participant
					agents under the control of the same participant.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5><dfn>Credential Service</dfn> (CS)</h5>
				<p>
					The CS manages <a>Verifiable Credentials</a>. This includes read and write endpoints for Verifiable
					Presentations (VPs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5><dfn>DID Service</dfn> (DIDS)</h5>
				<p>
					The DIDS creates, signs and publishes DID documents.
				</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4><dfn>Issuer Service</dfn> (IS)</h4>
			<p>
				The Issuer Service is run by trust anchor and manages the lifecycle of Verifiable Credentials in a
				dataspace. A dataspace may contain multiple Issuer Services run by different trust anchors. The
				Issuer Service:
				<ul>
					<li>Issues VCs for dataspace participants</li>
					<li>Manages revocation lists for VC types it issues based on Verifiable Credentials Status List v2021 [[vc-bitstring-status-list-20230427]].</li>
					<li>
						Provides cryptographic material used to verify VPs and VCs. If this is in the form of a DID, the Issuer
						Service may use the Identity Hub DID Service.
					</li>
				</ul>
