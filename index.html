	<h2><dfn>Tractus-X Dataspace Topology</dfn></h2>
	<section>
		<h3>
			Introduction
		</h3>
		<p>
			This document details the systems topology that Tractus-X dataspaces employ. This topology adheres to the
			model defined by the <a href="https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/dataspace-protocol/overview/model">Dataspace Protocol Specifications</a>
			(DSP):
			<ul>
				<li>The <dfn>Dataspace Authority</dfn> manages the dataspace. In a Tractus-X dataspace, this role may be
					federated across multiple operating companies responsible for registration, onboarding, and
					operations management.
				</li>
				<li>A <dfn>Participant</dfn> is a member the dataspace. In a Tractus-X dataspace, members may take on
					different roles, which are attested to by <a>Verifiable Credentials</a>
				</li>
				<li>A <dfn>Participant Agent</dfn> performs tasks such as publishing a catalog or engaging in an asset
					transfer. Note that a participant agent is a logical construct and does not necessarily correspond
					to a single runtime process.
				</li>
				<li>An <dfn>Identity Provider</dfn>  is a service that generates ID tokens used to verify the identity
					of a Participant Agent. In a Tractus-X dataspace, each participant will use their own identity
					provider, which may be self-hosted or hosted in a managed environment.
				</li>
				<li>A <dfn>Credential Issuer</dfn> issues <a>Verifiable Credentials</a> (VC) used by participant agents to
					allow access to assets and verify usage control
				</li>
				<li>
					<dfn>Verifiable Credential</dfn> see [[vc-data-model]]
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>
			Scope
		</h3>
		<p>
			This specification does not cover dataspace <dfn data-lt="registration service">registration systems</dfn> managed by a <a>Dataspace Authority</a>
			(operating company) as the participant registration and discovery process is out-of-scope.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>
			Identities
		</h3>
		<p>
			The DSP specifications are based on the concept that all participants have a stable identifier (ID). This
			ID is typically a number assigned to the participant business entity. In this scheme, <a>participant agent</a>
			identities may be ephemeral since all operations such as signing contract agreements are associated with the
			participant identity. This specification will also make use of DIDs [[did-core]], which can be employed to
			cryptographically verify a participant identity. These are related as follows:
		</p>
		<pre class="noghighlight">
			ID  ------ Can resolve to -----> DID
			^                                |
			|                                |
			|----------Associated with--------
		</pre>
		<p>
			A DID may also be used as an ID, but it is recommended to distinguish the two to allow for DID rotation.
			For example, a participant may opt to change its hosting environment, resulting in a change to its DID such
			as the URL associated with its DID in the case of `did:web` or its DID method. Since its Identifier remains
			stable, existing signed contracts will not be impacted.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Systems</h3>
		<section>
			<h4><dfn>Registration system</dfn></h4>
			<p>The registration system is responsible for participant registration, onboarding, and management.</p>
			<section>
				<h5><dfn>Registration process</dfn></h5>
				<p>
					When a participant is onboarded, it will be assigned an ID and either a secret token/code or
					Membership VC that will allow the participant to bootstrap its systems. If provided a secret token,
					the participant will be able to exchange it for a Membership VC with a <a>Credential Issuer</a>.
				</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4><dfn>Participant Agent Systems</dfn></h4>
			<p>
				Participants will run one or more agent systems that interact in the dataspace. These systems may offer
				data catalogs, perform data transfers or provide application functionality.

				A participant may run the following identity-related agents. Note that this is a logical description
				and may not represent an actual deployment topology.
			</p>
			<section>
				<h5><dfn data-lt="Secure Token Service|STS">Security Token Service</dfn> (STS)</h5>
				<p>
					The STS creates self-issued authorization tokens that contain identity claims used by participant
					agents under the control of the same participant.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5><dfn>Credential Service</dfn> (CS)</h5>
				<p>
					The CS manages <a>Verifiable Credentials</a>. This includes read and write endpoints for Verifiable
					Presentations (VPs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5><dfn>DID Service</dfn> (DIDS)</h5>
				<p>
					The DIDS creates, signs and publishes DID documents.
				</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4><dfn>Issuer Service</dfn> (IS)</h4>
			<p>
				The Issuer Service is run by trust anchor and manages the lifecycle of Verifiable Credentials in a
				dataspace. A dataspace may contain multiple Issuer Services run by different trust anchors. The
				Issuer Service:
				<ul>
					<li>Issues VCs for dataspace participants</li>
					<li>Manages revocation lists for VC types it issues based on Verifiable Credentials Status List v2021 [[vc-bitstring-status-list-20230427]].</li>
					<li>
						Provides cryptographic material used to verify VPs and VCs. If this is in the form of a DID, the Issuer
						Service may use the Identity Hub DID Service.
					</li>
				</ul>

	<h2><dfn>Identity Protocol Base</dfn></h2>
	<p>
		<section>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>
				This document defines a base protocol for communicating participant identities and claims in a Tractus-X
				dataspace. This specification assumes familiarity with the <a>Tractus-X Dataspace Topology</a>
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Motivation</h3>
			<p>
				The key goal of this protocol specification is to minimize the risk of business disruption related to the
				failure of identity and credential systems in a Tractus-X dataspace. As such, it provides a design for a
				decentralized system to communicate participant identities and <a>Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs).
			</p>
			<p class="note">
				Note that it is not a design goal of this protocol to support a self-sovereign data exchange network
				where each participant is in full control of its ability to operate on the network. Specifically,
				participants do not perform self-registration, and instead rely on a Registration Service. Imposing this
				restriction provides a mechanism for organizational security (the field of participants can be restricted
				through a verification process) and greatly simplifies the technical problem at hand.
			</p>
			<section>
				<h4>Decentralization</h4>
				<p>
					Decentralization is achieved in the following ways:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Self-Issued Identity Tokens</b> - Each participant is responsible for creating and
							cryptographically signing its own identity tokens. A central identity provider is therefore
							not required, eliminating a potential locus of network failure.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Participant VC and Cryptographic Material Management</b> - Each participant is
							responsible for storing VCs and presenting them (VPs) in the network. Each participant is
							also responsible for storing and making its own cryptographic material available to
							verifiers in the network. This specification defines how VCs are presented and verified
							without the need for a third-party verification service.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Multiple Trust Anchors</b> - Participant VCs are signed by a third-party issuer acting
							as a trust anchor using a cryptographic proof. The identity protocol allows for multiple
							trust anchors in a dataspace.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Identities and Identifiers</h3>
			<p>
				Each participant MUST have a unique, immutable <b>identity</b> provided by the <a>Registration Service</a> and a DID that it chooses. This relationship is expressed as:
			</p>
			<pre class="noghighlight">
			ID  ------ Can resolve to -----> DID
			^                                |
			|                                |
			|----------Associated with--------
			</pre>
			<p>
				This immutable identity is termed the `participant id`. In some dataspaces, the `participant id` may be
				a DID; otherwise there must be a mechanism to resolve a DID from a `participant id`.
				<section>
					<h4>The Membership VC</h4>
					<p>
						In the case where the `participant id` is not a DID, dataspaces which implement the TX identity
						protocol MUST define a VC that adheres to the Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1 [[vc-data-model]]
						and cryptographically binds the participant id to its DID. This VC is termed the Membership VC.
						The VC issuer's cryptographic material MUST be resolvable via a DID.
					</p>
				</section>
			</p>

		<section id="self-issued-id-tokens">
			<h3>Self-Issued ID Tokens</h3>
			<p>
				A Self-Issued ID Token is defined in the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.html#section-1.1">Self-Issued OpenID Provider v2 specification</a>.
			</p>
			<p class="note" title="quote">In the Self-Issued OP case, the ID Token is self-signed with a private key under the user's control, identified by the `sub` claim.</p>
			<p class="note" title="disclaimer">This specification does NOT require a complete implementation of the SIOPv2 specification</p>
			<p>A client may obtain a Self-Issued ID Token using a variety or OAuth grant types. If the OAuth 2.0 Client Credential Grant type is used, the client MUST conform to <a href="#get-sts-token">the section on obtaining STS-issued access tokens</a>.</p>
			<section>
				<h4>Self-Issued ID Token Contents</h4>
				<p>
					The Self-Issued ID Token MUST adhere to JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens
					[[rfc9068]] and MUST include the following claims:
					<ul>
						<li>The `iss` and `sub` claims MUST be equal and set to the bearer's (participant's) DID.</li>
						<li>The `sub_jwk` claim is not used.</li>
						<li>The `aud` set to the `participant_id` of the relying party (RP).</li>
						<li>The `jti` claim that is used to mitigate against replay attacks.</li>
					</ul>
					<section>
						<h5>VP Access Token</h5>
						<p>
							A Self-Issued ID Token MAY contain an access token as a `token` claim that can be used by
							the relying party to obtain additional VPs from a service under the control of the ID
							token issuer. The format of the `token` is implementation-specific and therefore must be
							treated as an opaque string by the relying party.

			<h3>Verifiable Presentations</h3>
			<p>
				Additional client metadata such as Verifiable Presentations can be obtained by a relying party (RP)

			<h3>Using the OAuth2 Client Credential Grant to Obtain Access Tokens from an STS</h3>
			<p>
				A Self-Issued ID Token MAY be obtained by a participant agent executing an OAuth 2.0 Client Credential
				Grant ([[rfc6749]], sect 4.4) against a <a>Secure Token Service</a> (STS) Endpoint. How the participant
				agent obtains the endpoint address is implementation-specific and beyond the scope of this specification.

				If a `token` is required to be included in the Self-issued ID token, the participant agent will need to
				request scopes for the access token. This is dependent on the API used to obtain the Self-Issued ID
				Token. An STS implementation MAY use endpoint parameters as defined by the OAuth 2 specification
				([[rfc6749]], sect. 8.2) to convey metadata necessary for the creation of the `token` claim. In this
				case, the Self-Issued ID Token request MAY contain a `bearer_access_scope` authorization request
				parameter set to a list of space-delimited scopes the `token` claim will be enabled for. If no
				`bearer_access_scope` parameter is present, the `token` claim MUST not be included.

	<h2>Verifiable Presentation Protocol</h2>
	<section>
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>
			This specification defines a protocol for storing and presenting Verifiable Credentials (VC) and other
			identity-related resources. The Verifiable Presentation Protocol (VPP) covers the following aspects:
			<ul>
				<li>Endpoints and message types for storing identity resources belonging to a holder in a <a>Credential
					Service</a></li>
				<li>Endpoints and message types for resolving identity resources</li>
				<li>Secure token exchange for restricting access to CS endpoints</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="note">
				Note that management endpoints for creating resource contexts, deleting resources, and
				defining access control are outside the scope of this protocol.
			</p>
			<section>
				<h4>Motivation</h4>
				<p>The Verifiable Presentation Protocol (VPP) is designed to address the problem of resolving Verifiable
					Presentations and other claims when they cannot be passed as part of a client request. For example,
					VPs often cannot be passed as part of an HTTP message header due to size restrictions. The protocol
					provides a secure mechanism for endpoints to resolve client resources. As part of this issue, the VPP
					also addresses how VC issuers can request the holder's CS to store issued credentials.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4>Terms</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Credential Service</b> - A network-accessible service that manages identity resources</li>
					<li>
						<dfn>Holder</dfn> - An entity that possesses a set of identity resources as defined by the
						W3C VC Data Model [[vc-data-model]]. The holder will typically be the subject of a VC.
					</li>
					<li><dfn>Resource</dfn> - A resource is an entity managed by the <a>Credential Service</a> such as a Verifiable Credential ( VC) or Verifiable Presentation (VP).</li>
					<li><dfn>Subject</dfn> - The target of a set of claims contained in a VC as defined by the W3C VC Data Model [[vc-data-model]]. In a dataspace, a subject will be a participant.</li>
					<li><dfn>DID</dfn> - A decentralized identifier as defined by the DID specification [[did-core]]</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4>Json-Ld Context</h4>
				<p>The VPP is based on Json-Ld message types. The CS Json-Ld context is:</p>
				<p>`https://w3id.org/tractusx-trust/v0.8`</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4>The Base Url</h4>
				<p>
					All endpoint URLs in this specification are relative. The base URL is implementation specific and may
					include additional context information such as a sub-path that disambiguates a holder.
				</p>
			</section>
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Presentation Flow</h3>
		<p>
			Below is a sequence where the client uses the OAuth 2 client credential grant flow as defined in the
			<a>Identity Protocol Base</a> Specification:
		</p>
		<figure id="vpp-flow">
			<img src="static/vpp.png" alt="Schematic sequence chart of data flow according to IATP VPP" />
			<figcaption>data flow according to IATP VPP</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			In the above sequence, the STS acts as an authorization endpoint for the client CS. The client requests a
			self-issued token including the `bearer_access_scope` authorization parameter set to an array of scopes that
			define the VPs the client wants the Verifier to have access to. This list of scopes is determined out of
			band and may be derived from metadata the verifier has previously made available to the client.
		</p>
		<p>
			The client receives the Self-Issued ID Token (containing an access token based on the `bearer_access_scope`
			value) and provides it with a request to access protected resources to the verifier. The verifier extracts
			the access token and uses it to request VPs from the client's CS. The verifier may resolve the CS endpoint
			through a variety of methods, for example, by resolving the client's DID document and using a service entry
			as described in <a href="#cs-endpoint-res">Section</a>. The VPs are then returned to the Verifier.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Security</h3>
		<p>
			CS endpoints may require an access token obtained from the resource owner. For example, a client (the
			resource owner) that needs to present a VP to an endpoint will provide an access token to the endpoint.
			The endpoint server will in turn use the access token when resolving the VP through a request to the
			client's Credential Service.

			The format of the access token is not defined. The only requirement is that the token can be used by the
			Credential Service to perform an access control check as defined in <a href="#access-scopes">Section
			access scopes</a>.
			<section>
				<h4 id="access-scopes">Access Scopes</h4>
				<p>Scopes are used to specify access privileges. A scope is a string value in the form:</p>
				<p>`[alias]:[descriminator]:[read|write|all]`</p>
				<p>The `[alias]` value may be implementation-specific. The `all` value indicates both `read` and `write` access.</p>
				<section>
					<h5>The `org.eclipse.tractusx.vc.type` Alias</h5>
					<p>The `vc.type` alias value must be supported and is used to specify access to a verifiable credential by type. For example:</p>
					<p>`org.eclipse.tractusx.vc.type:Member:read`</p>
					<p>denotes read-only access to the VC type `Member` and may be used to request a VC or VP.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h5>The `org.eclipse.tractusx.vc.id` Alias</h5>
					<p>The `org.eclipse.tractusx.vc.id` alias value must be supported and is used to specify access to a verifiable credential by id. For example:</p>
					<p>`org.eclipse.tractusx.vc.id:8247b87d-8d72-47e1-8128-9ce47e3d829d:read`</p>
					<p>denotes read-only access to the VC identified by `8247b87d-8d72-47e1-8128-9ce47e3d829d` and may be used to request a VC or VP.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h5>The `*` Wildcard Alias</h5>
					<p>Implementations must also support the `*` wildcard:</p>
					<p>`org.eclipse.tractusx.vc.type:*:write`</p>
					<p>The above expression enables write-only access to all VCs.</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4>Access Control</h4>
				<p>
					How access control is defined in a <a>Credential Service</a> is implementation-specific. Implementations
					may provide the ability to selectively restrict access to resources. The access control mechanism
					must support the scope restrictions defined in <a href="#access-scopes">Section access scopes</a>.
					Implementations may support additional restriction methods, including requiring the requester to
					present its own VPs.
					<section>
						<h5>Submitting an Access Token</h5>
						<p>
							Implementations that support access control require an access token. To provide the 
							opportunity for <a>Credential Service</a> implementations to enforce proof-of-possession,
							the access token MUST be contained in the `token` claim of a self-issued identity token as
							defined in <a href="#self-issued-id-tokens">Base Identity Protocol</a>. The self-issued
							token MUST be submitted in the HTTP `Authorization` header prefixed with `Bearer` of the
							request.
						</p>
					</section>
				</p>
			</section>
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Resolution API</h3>
		<p>
			If a client is not authorized for an endpoint request, the Credential Service may return `4xx Client Error`.
			The exact error code is implementation-specific.
		</p>
		<section>
			<h4>Query for Presentations</h4>
			<p>Presentations can be queried by POSTing a `PresentationQueryMessage` message to the query endpoint:</p>
			<p>POST /presentations/query</p>
			<p>The POST body is a `CredentialMessage` JSON object with the following properties</p>
			<ul>
				<li>`@context`: REQUIRED. Specifies a valid Json-Ld context.</li>
				<li>`@type`: REQUIRED. A string specifying the `PresentationQueryMessage` type.</li>
				<li>`presentationDefinition`: OPTIONAL. A valid `Presentation Definition` according to the <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v2.0.0/#presentation-definition">Presentation Exchange Specification</a>.</li>
				<li>`scope`: OPTIONAL. An array of scopes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A PresentationQueryMessage MUST contain either a presentationDefinition or a scope parameter. It is an error to contain both.</p>
			<p>The following are non-normative examples of the JSON body:</p>
			<pre class="json">
{
  "@context": [
    "https://w3id.org/tractusx-trust/v0.8",
